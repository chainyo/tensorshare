## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.8+ and [Hatch].

It is recommended to use `pipx` to install these tools to make it system-wide available:

```

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ hatch env create
$ hatch shell
```

```console
$ hatch run quality:check  # linting and code formatting without fixing

$ hatch run quality:format  # linting and code formatting with fixing and preview
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ hatch run tests:run
```


Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
